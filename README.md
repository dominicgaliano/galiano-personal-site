# Welcome to my personal website repository!

The purpose of this project is to:

1. Create my very own public facing website where I can document my coding experience and personal projects
2. Improve my front-end web development skills
3. Learn [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Please come along with me for the journey!

Until my website is up and running, I will be keeping a record of my progress in this readme file!

## November 8, 2022
I started my work today by aiming to select a framework with which to build my website. I initially thought that I would use a static framework like react-static, as I don't expect my website to require the use of very much dynamic content. However, I decided to use React as I believe that it will be the most useful front-end for me to learn. With that decision made, I began reading the [React tutorial documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
